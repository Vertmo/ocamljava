The OCaml-Java project uses different licences for its different components,
in order to match the licences of the corresponding elements in the original
OCaml distribution. The copyright holder for the whole OCaml-Java project is
Xavier Clerc.

The various components are:
  - the build system: "*.sh" files of the root directory, and all files of the
    "build/" directory;
  - the compiler: all files of the "compiler/" directory, and subdirectories;
  - the library: all files of the "library/" directory, and subdirectories;
  - the optimizer: all files of the "optimizer/" directory, and subdirectories;
  - the runtime: all files of the "runtime/" directory, and subdirectories;
  - the wrapper: all files of the "wrapper/" directory, and subdirectories.

The related licences are:
  - the LGPL for the build system, library, optimizer, runtime, and wrapper;
  - the QPL for the compiler.
The texts of the licences can be found in the files named "COPYING.GPL",
"COPYING.LGPL", and "COPYING.QPL" in the root directory.

The files in the "third-party/" directory are copies of software needed in
order to build OCaml-Java, and to then run files produced by its compiler.
Each archive contains the copyright and licensing information related to its
contents. The copyright and licenses of OCaml-Java therefore DO NOT apply to
the elements stored in the various archives of this directory.
