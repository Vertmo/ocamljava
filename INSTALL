Dependencies:
-------------
Most dependencies are provided as archives in the "third-party/" directory, but
the following elements are needed in order to build and then use OCaml-Java:
  - a "decent" shell
  - GNU Make 3.81
  - Apache Ant 1.8.0
  - JDK 1.7, with the "JAVA_HOME" environment variable properly set

Installation steps:
-------------------
./configure.sh -prefix <path> [options]  # also checks dependencies
./build.sh                               # also performs installation
./clean.sh                               # optional, removes all produced files

Configuration options:
----------------------
The full list of options accepted by the "./configure" script can be retrieved
by passing the "-help" option to the script. One option is mandatory: "-prefix
<path>" that is used to set the installation path. The specified path must be
absolute.


For additional information and required dependencies, please refer to the
manual available in the "doc/" directory.
